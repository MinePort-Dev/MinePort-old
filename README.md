# Installing the repository

There is nothing complicated here. Just clone the repository(or install in [.ZIP](https://github.com/maccree/MinePort/archive/v1.0.1beta.zip) format) to the minecraft folder ( ./minecraft):
```bash
$ git clone https://github.com/maccree/MinePort.git
```

### ATTENTION THIS IS IMPORTANT: First, throw the repository in the folder with minecraft, and only then add minecraft to the Steam library

# Preparing for the game
## 1. PC

You will need to install the Steam(do not be surprised, minecraft did not appear in the steam). We will need it for the new cloud gaming technology "Steam Remote Play"
Then go to your library and click on the "Add game" button in the lower left corner and select "Add a Non-Steam game" in the menu that appears"

Then, in the window that opens, we look for minecraft and add to your Steam-library

Now in minecraft itself, it is better to disable all resource packs, since this loads the devices and the network. As well as increasing the interface, it will just be easier for you to play.

## 2.Mobile device

And there are no settings on your mobile device, you just need to install the official app from Valve-Steam Link([IOS](https://apps.apple.com/us/app/steam-link/id1246969117)/[Android](https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.valvesoftware.steamlink)/[RasberryPi](https://steamcommunity.com/app/353380/discussions/6/2806204039992195182/))

Launch the SteamLink app and follow all the instructions in It(to link accounts) Then (right in the app) go to your game library and choose Minecraft there.

Go to settings and change the control to the one that will be convenient for you!
